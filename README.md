# Bisection Method

This is Bisection method with Java.

Bisection is a solution for numerical approximation, the root finding problem.

The function represented with a "f" method. Everyone can change the function. 


The function examples that I have already writen are from Numerical Analysis,Burden, Faires, 7th edition,
page 54, exercises 7.
